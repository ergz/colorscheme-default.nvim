# neodef.nvim

> [!WARNING]
> This comes from my neovim config. I created this plugin for a friend that liked my theme and wanted to try it out. I am going to keep this repository very minimal. You are welcome to open issues and/or PRs, but I will most likely recommend that you fork it and do as you please.

The neodef neovim theme, but with some minor improvements.
